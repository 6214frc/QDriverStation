# QJoysticks library

The QJoysticks library allows your Qt application to read input from both real joysticks/gamepads (using SDL) and a virtual joystick (using the keyboard).

SDL binaries and headers for Windows and OS X are already included in this library. Linux uses will need to install libsdl2-dev using the package manager of their distro of choice.
