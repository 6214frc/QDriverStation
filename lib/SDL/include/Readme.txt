SDL
===

These are the include files for the SDL library, which we use in order to get access to the joysticks connected to the user's computer.

Additional info:
----------------

- For QDriverStation, we use SDL 2 thanks to its greater support to Joysticks with the GameController class
- The compiled binaries for each platform are found in the "depends" folder in the root directory of the project
