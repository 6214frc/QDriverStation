QDriverStation README
=====================

This is the README file for the QDriverStation installer. 
If you are reading this, you've probably just run our installer 
and installed the QDriverStation on your system.


What should I do next?
----------------------

If you just want to drive your robot, you should be able to 
do so by running the  QDriverStation from the Start menu.

If you are running a version of Windows prior to Windows 8, we recommend you 
to download the Xbox joystick drivers from Microsoft:

What do I do if it doesn't work?
--------------------------------

The most common way to repair this would be to:

    - Check that you are actually connected to the robot
    - Check that your team number is correctly set

If that still doesn't work:

    - Open a command prompt
    - Ping the robot by typing (where XXYY is your team number):
      
          ping roboRIO-XXYY.local

    - If you get a response, copy the IP address of the roboRIO
    - Paste the IP address of the robot in the "Custom Address" field 
      in the settings dialog of the QDriverStation.
