<h1>QDriverStation README</h1>
<p>Thanks for downloading the QDriverStation! We hope that you have an excellent time trying it out.</p>
<p>If you need help with anything, feel free to contact me at: <a href="mailto:alex_spataru@outlook.com">alex_spataru@outlook.com</a></p>
<h2>Warnings</h2>
<p>The code has been thoroughly tested, however, please take into account the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Always <strong>check the joysticks tab before enabling the robot</strong>! The <em>QDriverStation</em> may map them differently than the official <em>FRC Driver Station</em>.</li>
<li>The keyboard shortcuts are the same as in the official <em>FRC Driver Station</em>. However, take into account that <strong>keyboard shortcuts will not work if the application/window is not focused</strong>.</li>
<li>Using the <em>QDriverStation</em> in a home network (e.g. for testing robot simulation) may temporarily slow down your router, since the <em>QDriverStation</em> uses parallel socket programming to detect the robot faster.</li>
<li>While we partially implemented support for the FMS, <strong>you should not use the <em>QDriverStation</em> in official <em>FRC</em> events</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>FAQs</h2>
<h4>1. Does the QDriverStation support the 2014 protocol?</h4>
<p>Yes, the <em>QDriverStation</em> has supported the FRC 2014 protocol since version 16.05.</p>
<h4>2. Does the QDriverStation support the 2015/2016 protocol?</h4>
<p>Yes, the <em>QDriverStation</em> has supported the FRC 2015 protocol since its initial release.</p>
<h4>3. Can I use the <em>QDriverStation</em> during an official <em>FIRST</em> event?</h4>
<p>No, you should not use or even try to use the <em>QDriverStation</em> in an official <em>FRC</em> event, for the following reasons:<ul><li>The FTA only allows teams to use the official <em>FRC Driver Station</em> during competitions for safety reasons.</li><li>The <em>QDriverStation</em> supports the FMS, however, the code is not tested and is based on observations only.</li></ul></p>
<h4>4. Does the QDriverStation check for updates?</h4>
<p>Yes. However, checking for updates will (obviously) not work if your robot is not connected to the Internet. We recommend you to launch the QDriverStation from time to time in an Internet-connected network to check for updates.</p>
<h4>5. Can I disable the QDriverStation updater?</h4>
<p>Yes, just open the preferences window and uncheck the <em>Check for updates automatically</em> checkbox.</p>
<h4>6. What is the <em>scan rate</em>?</h4>
<p>The QDriverStation uses a system of parallel sockets to detect the robot faster. You can control the number of parallel sockets by setting a custom scan rate (0 = automatic).<p>
<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Setting a very high <em>scan rate</em> may clog your system's resources. If the <em>QDriverStation</em> is slow to respond or it does not save/load settings correctly, try lowering the <em>scan rate</em>.</p>
<h4>7. I am interested in making my own Driver Station, where can I start?</h4>
<p>If you are interested in making your own GUI, check the <em><a href="http://github.com/wint-3794/libds">LibDS</a></em>, which deals with all the networking aspects of a Driver Station and allows you to load custom robot protocols (FRC 2014 and 2015/2016 protocols are already included in the library).</p>
<p>Also, check the <a href="https://github.com/WinT-3794/QDriverStation/blob/master/CONTRIBUTORS.md">CONTRIBUTORS</a> file, which contains several links that may be helpful to you.</p>
