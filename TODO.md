### TODO:

- Implement a layer over SDL in order to obtain the same joystick mappings as the ones used by the official FRC Driver Station.
- Implement 2014 protocol
- Implement FMS support for 2015/2016 protocol
- Implement a more robust mDNS responder class
- Implement code to communicate with FRC LabVIEW Dashboard (not only open it as we do)
- Test and improve joystick mappings for the most common controllers used in FRC (my team only has Xbox controllers, sorry)

### IDEAS:

- Implement our own Qt-based Dashboard
- Implement a window with graphs and diagnostics (similar to those of the FRC Driver Station)
