TODO:

- Refactor the main window components to simplify the code base and get rid of the generated boiler-plate code.
- Implement a layer over SDL in order to obtain the same joystick mappings as the ones used by the official FRC Driver Station.
- Implement unit tests, at least in the DS library
- Implement 2014 protocol
